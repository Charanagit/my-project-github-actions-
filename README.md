CI/CD Pipeline Project
Overview

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline for Python and Java projects using GitHub Actions and Docker.
Whenever code is pushed to the repository, the pipeline automatically builds, tests, containerizes, and deploys the application.

Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

Java JDK

Git

Docker

Getting Started

Install dependencies

# For Python projects
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Java projects
# Ensure your build tool (Maven/Gradle) is properly configured


Push your code to GitHub

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main


Once you push, the GitHub Actions pipeline will automatically trigger, performing:

Code validation

Unit testing

Containerization via Docker

Deployment to your configured environment

Notes

Ensure your Docker daemon is running before pushing code.

Make sure your GitHub Actions workflows are enabled in the repository settings
